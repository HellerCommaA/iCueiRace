This project is still in active development.


The overall goal of this project is to have iRacing (via it's SDK) control the LED fans (Corsar LL series) in my computer to act on the colors of a given session.


The iRacing SDK is from here: https://github.com/vipoo/irsdk

The corsair SDK is from here: https://github.com/CorsairOfficial/cue-sdk
